    <p class="paragraph">Tyler and Chloe met in their early years of college and were aquantancies for a few years before going on a date.Their first date was going to dinner and a movie. There were sparks immediately, talking non-stop until the movie. In hindsight, movies arent the best first date activity (not even able to talk!). After the movie they walked to the parking lot, and shared their first kiss. Time stood still, and in the moment they were the only two people on the planet. Immediately after Chloe and Tyler's first date, both of them went on vacations. Unable to see eachother for two weeks, they planned their next date for when they both got back. Ever since that first date, Tyler and Chloe have been inseperable. They started dating July 5th, 2018, and told eachother I love you within three weeks. Tyler and Chloe moved in together, and haven't left eachothers side.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">In June of 2021 they planned a trip to New York, for a much needed break. What Chloe did not know, is that Tyler was planning to propose. On June 18th 2021, Tyler and Chloe left their hotel early in the morning to walk through Central Park. As they were walking, they came upon a castle in the middle of central park. Since they had been walking for about an hour at that point, they settled down at the top of the castle to look down over the pond at the bottom. Tyler asked Chloe if she wanted to take a picture with the castle in the background, and she said yes. As they walked up to the bottom of the pond, Tyler asked a woman sitting there taking pictures if she'd be willing to take one for them. This woman was no random person, but a photographer there to catch Tyler propose. As she set up the photo, Tyler bent down on one knee and popped the question. </p>
